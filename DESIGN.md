## Design Context

### Users
Power users and tasteful hackers who want always-on AI agents with a minimalist, collaborative approach. They value control over their infrastructure, appreciate good tooling, and have strong aesthetic sensibilities. They use Alook in focused work sessions — managing agents, reviewing task output, and iterating on instructions.

### Brand Personality
**Warm, precise, and utilitarian.** Alook feels like a well-crafted tool made by someone who cares — not cold and corporate, not flashy and consumer. It earns trust through restraint and clarity. Every element has a reason.

3-word personality: **Warm. Sharp. Purposeful.**

Emotional goals: confidence, calm focus, quiet delight in small details.

### Aesthetic Direction
**Visual tone**: Notion-inspired warmth meets developer-tool precision. Soft neutral palette (warm grays, cream tints) with crisp typography and intentional micro-interactions. Light and airy in light mode, cozy and focused in dark mode.

**References**: Notion (polished, warm, delightful micro-interactions), vintage Macintosh product photography (warm object on cool ground, generous negative space, matte textures)

**Anti-references**:
- Generic SaaS dashboards (blue buttons, card grids, cookie-cutter layouts)
- AI chatbot UIs (ChatGPT-style centered chat with big rounded bubbles and gradients)
- Playful/consumer apps (bright colors, illustrations, emoji-heavy, gamification)

**Theme**: Both light and dark as first-class citizens. Warm-tinted neutrals in both modes — never pure gray.

### Design Principles

1. **Every pixel earns its place** — No decorative filler. If an element doesn't help the user accomplish their goal, remove it. Whitespace is a feature, not wasted space.

2. **Warm precision** — Technical doesn't mean cold. Use warm color tints, generous spacing, and thoughtful transitions to make the tool feel human without being cute.

3. **Progressive disclosure** — Start simple, reveal depth through interaction. The interface should feel approachable on first use and powerful on the hundredth.

4. **Motion with meaning** — Animate state changes to orient the user, not to impress. A well-timed 200ms transition beats a flashy 2-second animation.

5. **Respect the craft** — This is a tool for people who appreciate good tools. Match the quality they expect from their best CLI utilities — fast, predictable, and delightful in the details.

### Progressive disclosure

Never show all options at once. Complexity exists but stays one interaction away.

- **Hover to preview** — hovering a linked page shows a preview without navigating. Tooltips appear contextually, not eagerly.
- **Click to expand** — sidebar tree nodes, dropdown menus, and kanban column options are collapsed by default. Expanded state is driven by user action, not by default.
- **Scrolling reveals depth** — additional features and settings appear as the user scrolls or explores. The first screen is always clean.

## Color & Texture Philosophy

Inspired by vintage Macintosh product photography — a warm cream object on a dusty periwinkle ground, matte textures, even lighting, and nothing competing for attention.

### Lessons

- **Temperature contrast over color variety** — One warm tone (cream/beige) against one cool tone (muted blue) creates more visual interest than five harmonious colors. Limit the palette, let temperature do the work.
- **Desaturated > saturated** — Dusty, powdery, slightly muted tones feel confident and timeless. Fully saturated colors feel loud and cheap. When picking any accent, pull it 20-30% toward gray.
- **Matte everything** — Avoid glossy effects, specular highlights, and glass-morphism. Matte surfaces feel tactile, calm, and honest. Shadows should be soft and diffuse, never sharp or dramatic.
- **Generous negative space is the luxury** — One element with room to breathe feels more expensive than ten elements packed together. When in doubt, add space, not content.
- **Nostalgia as warmth, not kitsch** — Reference the feeling of early personal computing (optimism, simplicity, human scale) without literal retro styling. Warm tints and rounded-but-not-bubbly shapes evoke this without cosplaying the past.

## Visual Harmony

Every pixel should reduce mental load, not add it. Whitespace, typography, and hierarchy aren't cosmetic — they're how brains process information.

- The UI should fade into the background. If a user notices the tool instead of their content, something is wrong.
- Aim for visual calm: Japanese minimalism, Bauhaus clarity. No decoration that doesn't serve comprehension.
- If a feature makes the interface more complicated without making it more powerful, cut it.

## Loading to Loaded Stability

The transition from loading to loaded must feel like a *reveal*, not a *rearrangement*. The user's eye should never lose its place.

### Core rule
The loading skeleton and the loaded content must occupy the **same dimensions, position, and layout flow**. Nothing should jump, shift, or reflow when data arrives.

### Guidelines

- **Reserve exact space** — Skeleton placeholders must match the height, width, and margin of the real content they replace. A skeleton card that is 20px shorter than the loaded card causes a visible pop.
- **Anchor scroll position** — If content loads above the viewport (e.g. prepending items), compensate scroll offset so the user's visible content stays pinned.
- **Fade, don't swap** — Use a short crossfade (150–200ms, ease-out) to transition from skeleton to content. Avoid hard cuts where a gray block snaps to text in a single frame.
- **Match structure, not just size** — Skeleton shapes should echo the content layout (e.g. a line for a title, a shorter line for metadata, a block for an avatar). Generic identical bars feel lazy and make the transition more jarring, not less.
- **No Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** — Treat any visible layout shift during load as a bug. Images must have explicit dimensions or aspect-ratio containers. Dynamic lists should use fixed-height rows or virtualized containers.
- **Empty states hold the frame** — When a section loads but has zero items, the empty state placeholder must fill the same region the skeleton occupied. Don't collapse the container.
- **Stagger gracefully** — If multiple sections load independently, each section transitions on its own timeline. One section loading should never cause another to reflow.
- **Avoid spinners as primary indicators** — Prefer inline skeletons over centered spinners. Spinners displace content and create a jarring before/after. Use spinners only for actions (button presses, form submissions) where there is no content to skeleton.
