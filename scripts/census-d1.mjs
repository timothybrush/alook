/**
 * C2-close census (PR-C3②-AST, Blondie / Aigneis). The predicate-INDEPENDENT
 * backstop that decides "D1-armor is complete" — run once at C2 close, NOT per
 * commit. baseline=0 only proves the hole-CLASSES we thought of are covered;
 * this directly enumerates every real D1 execution point and demands each has a
 * bucket. It uses the SAME `execPoints`/`enclosingCarrier` as the ratchet, so
 * its precision equals the ratchet's (Aigneis's backstop invariant — a coarser
 * census would carry the same blind spot it exists to catch).
 *
 * OUTPUT IS BUCKET-ANNOTATED, NOT binary (Aigneis #236): every execution point
 * is assigned to a bucket —
 *   armored          — inside a carrier closure
 *   baseline         — a deliberately-bare point tracked in the point baseline
 *                       (e.g. ws-durable.ts:1005 audit — benign, intentional)
 *   UNASSIGNED       — bare AND not in the baseline = a real blind spot
 * C2-DONE ⟺ zero UNASSIGNED points. A deliberately-bare point (baseline) stays
 * "bare" forever but is a known, decided exception — it does NOT block close.
 * Reporting only "diff empty/non-empty" would either declare C2 never-done (the
 * audit point keeps it non-empty) or pressure someone to armor a benign point
 * against the "deliberately not retried" ruling.
 *
 * SCOPE-SET — the whole D1-touching surface, empirically the 3 access modes
 * (barrel `queries.`, namespace-path import, direct handle), minus the leaf
 * query defs (`db/queries/**` — those are the retry UNITS; armor wraps at the
 * caller). ③ non-community D1 is out of this round's scope (documented).
