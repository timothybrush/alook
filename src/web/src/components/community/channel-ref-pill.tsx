/**
 * Pure — takes already-computed inputs, decides what to render. No hooks.
 * This repo has no jsdom/testing-library, so a component that calls
 * `useChannelRefDirectory`/`useThreads`/`useCommunityStore`/`useRouter`
 * directly can't be unit-tested the way this function can — mirrors the
 * precedent set by `use-server-members.ts`, which extracts its reducers so
 * hookless logic stays testable and leaves the hook wiring itself untested.
 *
 * Decision table:
 * - `resolved === null` (still loading OR genuinely unresolved) →
 *   `directoryLoading ? "muted" : "plain"` (plain text = `ref`, untouched
 *   fallback — never a broken-looking pill).
 * - `resolved` present, no `threadRootSeq` → `"pill"`, label =
 *   `resolved.channel.name`, `serverPrefix` set only when the ref points at
 *   a different server than the one currently open.
 * - `resolved` present, `threadRootSeq` set:
 *   - `thread === undefined` (still loading) → `"muted"` (base channel label).
 *   - `thread` found (`parentSeq` match) → `"pill"` targeting the thread id,
 *     label = thread name.
 *   - `thread === null` (loaded, no match) → `"pill"` targeting the base
 *     channel — graceful degrade. The caller is responsible for appending
 *     the literal `/#{threadRootSeq}` as separate plain trailing text next
 *     to the pill, since that suffix is never part of the clickable target.
