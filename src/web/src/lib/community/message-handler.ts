/**
 * Server-synthesized idempotency key for a send that arrived WITHOUT a client
 * nonce (state 4a fallback). `createCommunityMessage` is an append-only write:
 * a resend of the same logical message over a response-losing gateway would
 * otherwise double-write, because the dedup partial index only fires when
 * `client_nonce IS NOT NULL`. Our own clients (web composer + bot CLI) always
 * send a nonce, so this fallback is for third-party / nonce-less clients only.
 *
 * The key is a `srv:`-prefixed content fingerprint over (author, channel,
 * content, replyTo). The `srv:` namespace can't collide with a real client
 * nonce (those are bare UUIDs), so a nonce-less resend and a with-nonce send
 * never dedup into each other. NO time component: a response-lost replay lands
 * seconds-to-minutes after the original and must hit the SAME key regardless of
 * interval; a time window in the key would let the replay miss and double-write
 * (the window belongs to GC of old nonce rows, not to key equality).
 *
 * The fingerprint MUST cover attachment identity, not just text: a send with
 * empty content + attachments is legitimate, so two distinct attachment-only
 * sends (different images, no text, no replyTo) would otherwise fingerprint
 * identically and the second would be silently collapsed as a "replay" — a
 * dropped message. So `attachmentKeys` (human upload URLs or agent pending ids)
 * are folded in; a real replay carries the same attachments and still dedups.
 *
 * Tradeoff (ratified): two DISTINCT sends with identical (author, channel,
 * content, replyTo, attachments) and no client nonce collapse to one.
 * Distinguishing a replay from an intentional duplicate is only possible with a
 * per-send client token (a nonce); a content fingerprint provably cannot. Our
 * clients send nonces (intentional duplicates get distinct nonces and pass
 * through), so this only bites a nonce-less client, accepted as a rare-fallback
 * known edge.
