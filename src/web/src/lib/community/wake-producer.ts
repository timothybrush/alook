/**
 * Push-wake producer — after a message lands and the human-WS fanout has
 * broadcast it, this filters the fanout's recipient set down to "bots that
 * are actually behind on this scope" and hands one minimal `{ messageId,
 * botUserId }` payload per candidate off to a `WakeTransport`
 * (minimal-wake-queue-unread-notice plan §1/§5). Deliberately carries NO
 * `HostCommand`, `machineId`, runtime, or message content — the consumer
 * (real `alook-wake-worker`, in both transports — see `wake-transport.ts`)
 * rebuilds the `agent:wake` command from CURRENT D1 state at consume time
 * (`dispatchOneUnreadWake`/`buildUnreadWakeCommand`), so a stale item never
 * wakes an old machine or carries stale content.
 *
 * This module owns ONLY "who are the candidates" — it never talks to
 * `WAKE_QUEUE`/`WAKE_WORKER` directly and never re-implements what happens
 * to a candidate. See `wake-transport.ts` for which transport runs in which
 * environment and why (local Cloudflare Queues can't bridge separate
 * `wrangler dev`/`next dev` processes today).
