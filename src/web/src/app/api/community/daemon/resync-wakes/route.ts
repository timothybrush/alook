/**
 * POST /api/community/daemon/resync-wakes
 *
 * Daemon-initiated recovery for the "message sent while the daemon was
 * offline" gap: the queue consumer acks (never retries) a wake whose
 * daemon was unreachable at delivery time (`dispatchOneUnreadWake`'s
 * `attempted_nowhere` outcome) — that queue item is gone for good. Rather
 * than the server pushing a catch-up wake on its own when the daemon's WS
 * reconnects, the DAEMON proactively calls this route right after it opens
 * its control-plane connection (`channel.onOpen()`), asking "do any of my
 * bots still have unread work?".
 *
 * This route decides nothing new about addressing/config — for every bot
 * bound to `ctx.machineId` with pending unread, it calls the SAME
 * `dispatchOneUnreadWake` the real `alook-queue-worker` queue consumer uses,
 * which re-reads current D1 state and forwards a freshly built `agent:wake`.
 * Because the daemon's WS just connected, `sendWakeToMachine` finds a live
 * socket this time and delivers immediately.
