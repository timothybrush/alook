/**
 * GET /api/community/channels/:id/read-state
 *
 * Snapshot of the viewer's read pointer for a single channel. Consumed once
 * per channel mount to compute the "New" divider anchor and initial scroll
 * position. Returns `{ null, null }` when the viewer has never visited the
 * channel — the caller treats that as "everything is new, but no divider
 * (start at the bottom)", matching common chat-app first-visit UX.
 *
 * Contract mirrors the sibling `read` route: 404 for unknown channels, 403
 * for non-members. The two-step check preserves that ordering (unknown →
 * 404, known-but-not-a-member → 403); `requireChannelMember` alone collapses
 * both into 403.
