 *   - Remove others: CREATOR only (add is open to members, but evicting someone
 *     else is the creator's call; admins have no content privilege here).
 *   - The creator can never be removed OR self-leave (they own the unit).
 * The removed user gets a CHANNEL_MEMBER_REMOVE so their sidebar drops the
