/**
 * GET /api/community/channels/:id/bootstrap
 *
 * The de-serialized channel-open payload. See
 * plans/community-switch-perf-optimization.md (WS2). Instead of the client
 * firing `read-state`, waiting for it, then firing `messages?anchor=` (two
 * serial network round-trips gated client-side), this route does BOTH server
 * side behind ONE `requireChannelMember` preflight and returns them together:
 *
 *   { readState, messages, hasMoreOlder, hasMoreNewer, olderCursor,
 *     newerCursor, latestSeq }
 *
 * The `messages` payload is byte-identical to what the `messages` route's
 * anchor/legacy branch returns (same `enrichMessages`, same anchor-mode
 * envelope with `hasMoreOlder`/`hasMoreNewer`), so the client can seed its
 * existing message cache and let `useMessages` paginate + WS-patch unchanged.
 *
 * Only the INITIAL window lives here; pagination stays on the `messages` route.
