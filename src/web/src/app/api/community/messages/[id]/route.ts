/**
 * GET /api/community/messages/[id]
 *
 * Returns a single fully-hydrated message (attachments + reactions + reply
 * preview) shaped by `mapMessageForApi`. Currently the only client of this is
 * the thread-view "opener" block — when the user opens a thread channel, the
 * client fetches the parent message via its `parentMessageId` pointer and
 * renders it pinned at the top of the message list.
 *
 * Access model: the caller must have access to the surface the message lives
 * in — a server member for channel messages, a DM participant for DM messages.
 * This is deliberately the SAME check as GET /channels/[id]/messages: since
 * server membership grants access to every channel in the server, a thread
 * viewer who can read the thread's messages can also read the outer channel's
 * parent-message opener. No separate "is this a parentMessageId of a thread I
 * can see" branch is needed — the server-scoped check subsumes it.
