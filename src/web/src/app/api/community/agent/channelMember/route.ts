/**
 * POST /api/community/agent/channelMember — `alook channel member --channel <ref>`.
 * Returns the followed members of a channel/thread.
 *
 * Branches by resolved target:
 *   - DM ref → 400 (channel-scoped). Rejected UP FRONT (before
 *     `resolveTargetForMember`) so an un-opened DM surfaces the correct
 *     channel-scoped 400 instead of a misleading 404 "dm not found".
 *   - thread (`type = "thread"`) → always private on the wire; returns the
 *     thread-participant roster (`community_thread_participant`). The
 *     parent-channel visibility does not leak here; a thread carries its own
 *     notify set irrespective of its parent's public/private state.
 *   - forum post (`type = "forum_post"`) → always private on the wire — a
 *     post is its own access unit even inside a PUBLIC forum, and the roster
 *     is the post-scoped member set, not the whole server.
 *   - public top-level channel/forum → `{ visibility: "public", hint }` (no
 *     roster enumeration — every server member can see it, so the agent should
 *     use `alook server member --server <name>` instead).
 *   - private channel / private forum → `{ visibility: "private", members }`
 *     sourced from `resolveScopeMembers` (the same audience the fan-out and
 *     human UI use).
