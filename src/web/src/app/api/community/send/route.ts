/**
 * POST /api/community/send — moved from /api/community/agent/send (plan §4
 * MOVE-FLAT, §9 phase 3). Ref-addressed bot send: body `{ channel, content,
 * attachments, replyToSeq?, seenUpToSeq?, nonce? }` where `channel` is a REF
 * (kept, not id — Gener #68). This is why it CANNOT fold onto the human
 * `channels/[id]/messages` POST (Fork B): a bot holds a ref, the CLI can't
 * resolve it to a channelId, so `resolveTargetForMember` runs server-side (and
 * that resolve is also where create-DM/thread-if-missing happens). Humans send
 * via the `[id]` route; this flat verb is bot-only → human actor rejected 403
 * (`requireBot`, Gener #116). Handler body is unchanged from the /agent
 * original except the wrapper + identity source (ctx.botUserId → botUserId).
 *
 * Single resolve, WITH create flags (`createDmIfMissing`/`createThreadIfMissing:
 * true`), rather than a read-only-then-mutating double resolve. Behaviorally
 * identical: a DM/thread row can only be auto-created when it has NEVER had a
 * message sent to it, so that scope's `community_message_seq` counter is absent
 * (`latestSeq === 0`) — it is IMPOSSIBLE for the alignment gate to block a send
 * into a target that doesn't exist yet (blocking requires `latestSeq > seen`,
 * `seen >= 0` always). So auto-create never fires on a request this gate would
 * have blocked — a single resolve is safe and avoids a redundant round trip.
