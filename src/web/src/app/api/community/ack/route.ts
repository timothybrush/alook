/**
 * POST /api/community/ack — plan §7. The ONLY endpoint that advances
 * `lastReadSeq` (`inboxPull` never mutates read state — debt #2 correction).
 * Each cursor's `channel` ref is resolved read-only (no DM/thread
 * auto-create — a stale ref must never materialize a row as a side effect
 * of an ack) and membership-gated before `bumpReadCursor`.
 *
 * Moved from /agent (plan §4 MOVE, §9 phase 3); bot-only, human actor → 403 via requireBot (Gener #116).
 *
 * Best-effort per cursor, NOT fail-fast: every good cursor is applied and its
 * waterline advanced regardless of any sibling cursor failing. A single
 * unresolvable cursor (e.g. a forum_post whose ref can't parse back) must
 * never stall the healthy cursors behind it — that regressed their waterlines
 * and muted the bot in every channel with unread. Bad cursors are collected
 * into `failed[]` with a coarse `code`; the response is ALWAYS 200 (partial
 * success is not a request-level error — the good cursors DID apply, and the
 * daemon must not treat the whole call as failed). Only a genuine D1 exception
 * escaping `withD1Retry` propagates as a 500 so the daemon retries the batch.
