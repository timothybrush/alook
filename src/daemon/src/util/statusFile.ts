/**
 * Atomic status-file writer for the `daemon status` snapshot (batch E2).
 *
 * The FSM daemon has NO IPC — `daemon stop`/`list`/`status` are separate CLI
 * processes, and `manager.snapshot()` lives only inside the running daemon. So
 * to answer "what is each agent's FSM state right now" out-of-band, the running
 * daemon periodically writes a slim projection to `<baseDir>/status.json` and
 * the `daemon status` CLI reads that file (Cecilia's ruling (a): snapshot-file,
 * not a control listener — zero new network/attack surface, crash-safe: if the
 * daemon dies the last frame is still readable). See plans/daemon-fsm-desync.md.
 *
 * ATOMIC: write to `<path>.tmp` then `rename` over `<path>`, so a concurrent
 * `daemon status` read never sees a half-written file (rename is atomic on the
 * same filesystem). Best-effort: a status write must NEVER break the daemon, so
 * failures are swallowed — a missing/stale status file is a tolerable "unknown",
 * far better than a crash.
