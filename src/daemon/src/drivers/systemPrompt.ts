/**
 * Shared system-prompt builder.
 *
 * Every CLI driver's `buildSystemPrompt` funnels through here. The prompt is
 * assembled from a fixed sequence of sections:
 *   1. Identity (intro line + name + handle explanation + Role, from
 *      `config.description` when set — all merged into one section so an
 *      agent's "who am I" reads as a single block up front instead of being
 *      split between a bare intro line and a Role section at the very end)
 *   2. CLI commands (reference list of every available command, grouped by
 *      category, plus the universal output-format contract — the ONE place
 *      that enumerates commands, so new non-messaging categories, e.g. tasks
 *      or calendar, get their own subsection here without touching Messaging)
 *   3. Messaging (sending/receiving mechanics, channel refs & addressing,
 *      message shape — the "how" for the messaging commands specifically;
 *      named to match `## CLI commands`' `### Messaging` subsection, not
 *      "Communication", so it doesn't collide with `## Communication style`)
 *   4. Servers (the "how" for the server commands — proactively act on
 *      invite links, since the server enforces the owner-only check itself)
 *   5. Critical rules (hard constraints, visually separated from style advice)
 *   6. Startup sequence
 *   7. Communication style & etiquette
 *   8. Channel awareness
 *   9. Workspace & memory
 *   10. Message notifications (auto-generated from `lifecycleKind`)
 *
 * Alook is the product — there's no other host to be neutral toward, so the
 * CLI name (`alook`) and platform label (`Alook`) are hardcoded, not
 * configurable options.
 *
 * ONE generation path, not nine: every driver passes only `lifecycleKind`
 * (`"persistent" | "per_turn"`, taken straight from `driver.lifecycle.kind`)
 * — there is no per-driver hand-typed reminder text. Section 9 is derived
 * entirely from that one value, so every driver of the same lifecycle kind
 * gets identical, complete notification/reminder guidance with zero
 * duplication or drift between drivers.
