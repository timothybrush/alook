/**
 * Resolves `@Name` tokens in a community message body to userIds, given a
 * roster of candidate members. Matching is case-insensitive, longest-match
 * first (so `@John Doe` wins over `@John` when both exist).
 *
 * A match must:
 *  - be preceded by start-of-string or a non-identifier character
 *  - be followed by end-of-string or a non-identifier character
 *
 * Identifier characters are `\p{L}\p{N}_-` (Unicode-aware — `Member.name`
 * is a free Unicode string, so an ASCII-only class would silently fail to
 * resolve/notify mentions of names like `李四`/`José`/`Ünal`; this must
 * agree with the display-side regex in `chat-syntax-plugin.ts` or the pill
 * and the notification fan-out would disagree on which text is a mention),
 * so a name ending or starting in those plus the next-char rule covers
 * normal punctuation, spaces, and newlines as boundaries. Names containing
 * whitespace are supported.
 *
 * When a candidate carries a `discriminator`, an exact `@Name#0042` match is
 * tried FIRST at each `@` site (so a channel with two "Alex"es can be
 * disambiguated), falling back to the existing longest-bare-name match when
 * no `#0042` suffix is present or it doesn't match anyone.
