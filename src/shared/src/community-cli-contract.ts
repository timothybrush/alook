/**
 * Server API contract — the agent ⇄ server boundary.
 *
 * This is the single shared contract that BOTH sides implement against:
 *   - the **agent CLI** (the client) calls these methods;
 *   - a **server** (real Alook, or the local mock for tests) answers them.
 *
 * Lifted from `src/daemon/src/server/contract.ts` into `@alook/shared` so the
 * real server routes (`src/web`) and the wake producer/consumer
 * (`src/web`, `src/wake-worker`) can share the exact same types the daemon's
 * CLI and mock server already implement against. `src/daemon`'s
 * `contract.ts` re-exports everything from here — see that file.
 *
 * Domain model (Alook is Discord-like):
 *   User ──< Agent ──< (participates in) Server/workspace ──< Channel ──< Message
 *   - one User owns many Agents;
 *   - one Agent participates in many Servers (workspaces);
 *   - one Server has many Channels (+ DMs + threads);
 *   => because an agent spans multiple servers, **every Target carries a
 *      `server` reference** (a bare `#channel` would be ambiguous across servers).
 *
 * IDs are **nanoid** strings (not UUIDs).

 * is REJECTED on the addressing surfaces (a name resolved at use-time silently
 * mis-targets a renamed channel — the bug this design kills) and degrades to
 * plaintext in a message body. It survives only as the token's readable label.
 * Agents never resolve a name at use-time: they reuse a received ref's id
 * (`resolveTargetById`), or open a relationship channel by identity
 * (`resolveTargetByCreate` — `--dm-user`/`--thread-on`). (Server SELECTORS on
 * `list` verbs — `--server <id-or-name>` — are a separate, still-supported

//
// Colocated with `parseRef`/`formatRef` above so the two ref grammars — the
// addressing PATH (`/server/channel`) and the body TOKEN (`{}()`) — are defined
// in one place (Blondie #268). This is the AUTHORITATIVE definition; the web UI
// re-exports it from `src/web/src/lib/community/ref-token.ts` so the message
// renderer and the CLI share one parser (the daemon reaches this file via the
// `@alook/shared/community-cli-contract` subpath and never the main barrel, so
// the parser must live HERE, not in web, for the CLI to reuse it).
//
// A reference to a channel/message/server embedded in message text serializes as
//
//   {full-path label}(type/leafid)
//
// e.g. `{/Alook/general}(channel/K9f_rnJk)`, `{/Alook/general#42}(message/m_ab)`,
// `{/Alook}(server/srv_x)`. The `{}` label is the human-readable, self-describing
// fallback (shown on degrade / plaintext / copy-out); the `(type/leafid)` is the
// authoritative target — `type` names which table (channel/message/server ids
// are same-shape nanoids, so type can't be inferred), `leafid` locates it.
//
// `{}` is chosen because markdown leaves it literal (unlike `[]()` which becomes
// a link, or `<>` which becomes HTML/autolink; Gener #65). No escape layer: the
// label is a DISPLAY-ONLY fallback (the id is authoritative), so rather than
// escape the closing `}` inside it — which collides with markdown's OWN `\`
// escaping once the token sits in message body text — the producer simply
// strips `}` from the label (`sanitizeLabel`).

// Only two token types (ref/id §3.4b, Gener-ratified): the `()` payload is an
// addressing target that lives in one of two tables — a channel (community_channel;
// this also covers threads/forum-posts, which ARE channels) or a server. There is
// deliberately NO `message` type: a message is "a channel + a seq", not a third
// table, so message-vs-channel is inferred from whether the token's LABEL carries
// a `#<seq>` (`refDisplayParts`/`resolveMessageJump`), not from a type tag. The
// `()` holds the channelId either way; the seq (if any) rides the label. Encoding
// message as a type would (a) require a `/`-bearing id or a reverse-resolve to a
// seq — the id here is a single `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` segment — and (b) create a
// type-vs-label conflict (type=message but label has no seq). See §3.4b.

//   - `formatRefLabel` (plaintext previews) bakes it into a string with the

//     (`channel-icon.tsx`, a `/` slash) + a separate `#seq` suffix span.

// which would hand it the string form and lose the icon) is what lets the two
// outlets share the leaf/seq/sigil logic while each renders in its own medium.
//
// The TYPE picks the table (channel vs server). Within a `channel` token, the
// message-vs-plain-channel split is inferred from the LABEL — if it carries a
// `#<seq>` (`/server/channel#42`) it's a message pin, else the channel itself
// (ref/id §3.4b — there is no `message` type; a message = channel + seq). So:
//   server                    → { sigilKind: "server", leaf }
//   channel, label no seq     → { sigilKind: "channel", leaf }
//   channel, label has seq    → { sigilKind: "message", leaf: channel, seq }
// leaf + seq are parsed from the label via `parseRef` (the shared ref-grammar
// parser, NOT a hand-split — single ruler; Blondie #329/#331). The pill renders
// a message as `<icon> {leaf} #{seq}` (channel context), the preview as just
// `#{seq}` (the surrounding context already names the channel; Faustine #330).
//
// DISPLAY seq for a THREAD message (`/s/c/#N#M`): the ROOT seq N (which message
// opened the thread — the human-recognizable anchor), NOT the thread-internal M
// (ref/id #3, Faustine #332). This is the DISPLAY axis; the JUMP axis
// (`resolveMessageJump`) separately uses M to land on the exact thread message.
